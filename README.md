## Package Description:

###arithmetics.binaryconversion
Implement a converter of an integer to its binary representation eg.:
* 5 as binary is:    101
* 6 as binary is:    110
###lists.onedirectional
Implement basic operations on one-directional pointer list.
###misc.longestplateau
Find the longest plateau (constant value segment in a table.
###misc.monotoniccrud
If a set is represented as a monotonic array, implement CRUD operations on a set:
* union of sets
* union of sets without duplicates
* intersection
* minus (exception)
###searching.binary
Implement the binary search that finds the first and the last occurence of a value in a table, use it to get the number of occurences.
###searching.bitonic
Use binary search to find the maximum value in a bitonic table.
